Thank you for considering my application!

For this assignment, I began by reading and parsing the JSON file to extract the data. I then created a dictionary to assign weights to each permission, ensuring that the permission columns are displayed in the same order as shown in the example. By iterating through each user's permissions, I determined whether to append "1" or "0" based on whether the user has the corresponding permission.

To generate the CSV file, I utilized Python's csv module to write the processed rows to a file.

For integration with the Google API, I set up credentials for a service account, which is ideal for server-side operations or running scripts. Using these credentials, I updated the generated rows to a Google Sheet.

I have add credentials.json in the .gitIgnore, but I have an example example_credentials.json, which has the same format. 

The Google Sheet URL is "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dOHHogF4wgu4stGXcl_coS5vQ-FmS4D_6YYrdUXHT3Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0"
